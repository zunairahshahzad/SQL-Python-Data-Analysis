ðŸ§š**Project Overview** 
This project involved analyzing flight and booking data from an airlineâ€™s SQLite database to uncover insights that could help the company improve occupancy rates and profitability. The airline company was  facing profitability challenges due to external factors (e.g., rising fuel prices and interest rates) and needed data-driven strategies to optimize revenue without compromising service quality.

ðŸ§š**Key Notes**
- Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL (SQLite), Jupyter Notebook.
- Analyzed airline database to identify trends in occupancy and revenue in response to rising fuel prices and interest rates (data provided as SQLite database on Kaggle).
- Connected to the database using SQLite3, explored key tables, and extracted relevant data using SQL queries.
- Use Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine aircraft seating capacity, booking volume over time, and fare condition pricing.
- Identified strategies to improve occupancy rates on low-performing flights to increase revenue per seat.
- Analyzed trends in ticket bookings and revenue over time, revealing peak periods and stable patterns.
- Explored aircraft-specific fare and occupancy patterns to suggest pricing and seating capacity optimizations.
- Highlighted the importance of balancing revenue goals with customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance to boost long-term profitability.

ðŸ§š**Problem Statement, Hypothesis & Goal**
The airline was experiencing declining profitability due to economic factors. The hypothesis was that increasing occupancy rates, especially on underperforming flights, could boost revenue per seat. This required identifying patterns in booking behavior, aircraft performance, and fare structure effectiveness.

ðŸ§š**Tools & Techniques**
Data was extracted using SQL and analyzed using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Pandas was used for cleaning and transformation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for data visualization and trend analysis. 

ðŸ§š**Data Analysis & Insights**
- Explored the aircraft table and found that 6 out of 9 planes had more than 100 seats, indicating a preference or profitability advantage for higher-capacity aircraft.
- Analyzed booking and revenue data over time and identified a clear upward trend in ticket bookings between June 22 and July 7, followed by a stable pattern and a notable peak in early August, suggesting seasonal or promotional influence.
- Found that revenue patterns closely mirrored ticket bookings, reinforcing that passenger bookings were the primary revenue driver for the airline.
- Calculated average charges per aircraft under different fare conditions and found that both extremely high and low-priced tickets underperformed in occupancy. High-priced fares were not popular, likely due to cost sensitivity, while low-cost fares may have suffered from poor service perceptions.
- Highlighted that occupancy rate is critical to profitabilityâ€”higher occupancy reduces cost-per-seat and increases total earnings without additional flights.
- Suggested pricing and marketing adjustments based on aircraft type and fare sensitivity. This included that boosting occupancy requires more than just lower pricesâ€”it demands strategic pricing, service quality improvements, and alignment with customer preferences and peak demand periods.

ðŸ§š**Business Impact**
Delivered practical recommendations for improving occupancy on low-performing flights, optimizing ticket pricing by fare class, and aligning strategies with seasonal demand. Insights supported better decision-making to enhance customer experience, maximize profitability, and maintain safety and service quality.  The project emphasized how data-driven strategies can enhance profitability and support business goalsâ€”especially in high-impact industries like aviation.

ðŸ§š**Impact & Takeaways**
This project strengthened my ability to work with relational databases by integrating SQL and Python for end-to-end data analysis. I gained hands-on experience connecting to a SQLite database, writing complex queries to extract and join data across multiple tables, and transforming raw data into actionable insights. Through exploratory analysis and visualization with Python, I deepened my understanding of key business metrics like occupancy rate, revenue per seat, and pricing efficiency â€”and translated those into strategies for operational and financial improvement. I gained practical experience in using data to support strategic decisions in a real-world business context - enhancing my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.
